        <p class="lead">Everyone has his/her own type of Innate Domain. An abstracted imaginary domain that is formed from diverse interactions with the randomness of the world, which is flowing inside your mind, though not separating the self from this randomness of the universe. Keep being flowed with this randomness, be get compacted with emerged Symmetries, embrace all of them and let the Symmetry have emerged from randomness!</p>
