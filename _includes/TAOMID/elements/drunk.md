Almost going fade-out when my clarity is long-gone away. 
But I can feel every breath you are taking and your smells that consuming me. 
Damn! those are trying to sway me away into inside of you. 
It's not like these are the only things that try to. 
I got other strings too! Who cares! I got things to do. 
Gonna make a random-recursive-nested feelings from all of those and simplify 
those things no matter how deep these are! and gotta carve the abstracted one 
onto your body. A part of your body where no one but me with the will-free granted permission.
