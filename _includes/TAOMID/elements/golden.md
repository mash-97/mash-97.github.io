It's not like I understand these, set aside the colors. Inside my brain or may' my soul.
It was already been there or not. Without a spark or not. Defying it's hosted core, started
to disperse towards every visible and hidden dimensions without any direction.

It's also not like I know all the dimensions though, but through the feelings it gets through.

I may know it or not. It's growing, and It's trying to grow, tries to go beyond all the dimensions.
Put aside the hosted core!
