YO! got a present for ya. A wrapped compacted one. 
To have a closer look to see it from a better perspective, 
try to make a cleave on it. Intertwined strings that try to diverge 
towards outside of their domain, so movable yet giving you a vibe of 
static, tries to get twisted with your reality giving you a feel so 
surreal, unrealistic feelings it tries to give ya! Yeeh! It's better. 
But gotta be careful, the cat might get killed!
