No matter how much I flow with them. 
They just don't make any clarified sense. 
They just either get dispersed or get intertwined or 
get contracted into a single source or get recursive-nested nuggets or 
may be all of them together.


Either way they maybe comes from a source that is so symmetrical or 
so randomized or can be both them, symmetrical and randomized. 
Damn! getting intertwined with them again. 


Ain't they just what I call an un-clarified mind that is where they come from? So . .


"So, again, what is Zen? Stop now. Stop trying to get an intellectual lock on something that is vast and boundless, far more than the rational mind can grasp. Just breathe in with full awareness. Taste the breath. Appreciate it fully. Now breathe out, slowly, with equal appreciation. Give it all away; hold onto nothing. Breathe in with gratitude; breathe out with love. Receiving and offering—this is what we are doing each time we inhale and exhale. To do so with conscious awareness, on a regular basis, is the transformative practice we call Zen."
