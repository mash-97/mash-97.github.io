What should I call this?  a Fluctuating Mind! 
Cause every time I try to imprint something on, my mind gets boggled of what to do, 
what next move to make. 
It's like an adventure you keep fluctuating in uncertainty until you get used to 
venturing to the same adventure. It's just confusing as defining the exact present, 
when the present has already gone. Every point of time has it's own present.
And here I'm trying to imprint my mind, turns out it's my DynamicMind!
