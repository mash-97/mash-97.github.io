Almost going fade-out when my clarity is long-gone away. 
Cause some overstimulated feelings making my mind going scattered around. 
Then there you taking your breaths, trying to sway me away into inside of you. 
And your smells that I'm consuming. Feels like we are using each-other. 
It's not like these feelings are the only things that try to. 
I got other strings too! Damn! Who cares! I got things to do. 
Gonna make a random-recursive-nested feelings from all of those and simplify 
those no matter how deep those are! and gotta carve the abstracted one onto your body. 
A part of your body where no one but me with the will-free granted permission.
