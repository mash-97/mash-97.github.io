There's everything inside me what you see and what you don't see in this whole universe. 
I'm the summed-up phenomena of what's happening and what's not. 
It's my very existence what's giving the universe it's meaning. 
No matter which point I'm on I'm always at the center. 
And I wasn't been created nor been emerged. 
Cause I was always been there and maybe not!
