It's not like I understand these, set aside the colors. 
Inside my brain or may' my soul. They were already been there or not. 
Without a spark or not. Defying their hosted core, started to disperse 
towards every visible or hidden dimensions without any direction. 
It's not also like I know all the dimensions though, but the feelings they flow through.
I may know it or not. They are growing. And they are trying to grow, 
trying to go beyond all the dimensions. Put aside the hosted core!
