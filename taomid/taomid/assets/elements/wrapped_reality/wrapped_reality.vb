YO! got a present for ya. A wrapped compacted one. 
To have a closer look to see it from a better perspective, try to make a cleave on it. 
Intertwined strings that try to diverge towards outside of their domain, 
so movable yet giving you a vibe of static, 
tries to get twisted with your reality giving you a feel so surreal, 
unrealistic feelings they try to give ya! Huh! It's better. 
But gotta be careful, the cat might get killed!
