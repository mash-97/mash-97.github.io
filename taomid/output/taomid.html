    <p class="w3-opacity w3-cursive">Everyone has his/her own type of Innate Domain. 
An abstracted imaginary domain that is formed from diverse 
interactions with the randomness of the world, which is flowing inside your mind, 
though not separating the self from this randomness of the universe. 
Keep being flowed with this randomness, be get compacted with emerged Symmetries, 
embrace all of them and let the Symmetry have emerged from randomness!

Defying their hosted core, started to disperse towards every visible or hidden dimensions without any direction. It's not also like I know all the dimensions though, but the feelings they flow through. I may know it or not. They are growing. And they are trying to grow, trying to go beyond all the dimensions. Put aside the hosted core!</p>

It's not like these feelings are the only things that try to. I got other strings too! Damn! Who cares! I got things to do. Gonna make a random-recursive-nested feelings from all of those and simplify those no matter how deep these are! and gotta carve the abstracted one onto your body. A part of your body where no one but me with the will-free granted permission.</p>

    <p class="text-center text-justify">No matter how much I flow with them. They just don't make any clarified sense. They just either get dispersed or get intertwined or get contracted into a single source or get recursive-nested nuggets or may be all of them together.   Either way they maybe comes from a source that is so symmetrical or so randomized or can be both them, symmetrical and randomized. Damn! getting intertwined with them again.   Ain't they just what I call an un-clarified mind that is where they come from? So . .   "So, again, what is Zen? Stop now. Stop trying to get an intellectual lock on something that is vast and boundless, far more than the rational mind can grasp. Just breathe in with full awareness. Taste the breath. Appreciate it fully. Now breathe out, slowly, with equal appreciation. Give it all away; hold onto nothing. Breathe in with gratitude; breathe out with love. Receiving and offeringâ€”this is what we are doing each time we inhale and exhale. To do so with conscious awareness, on a regular basis, is the transformative practice we call Zen."
