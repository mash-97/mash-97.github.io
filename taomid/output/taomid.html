  <h3>Name: growing_dispersion</h3>
  <h3>vibe: </h3>
  <p>It's not like I understand these, set aside the colors. Inside my brain or may' my soul. They were already been there or not. Without a spark or not. Defying their hosted core, started to disperse towards every visible or hidden dimensions without any direction. It's not also like I know all the dimensions though, but the feelings they flow through. I may know it or not. They are growing. And they are trying to grow, trying to go beyond all the dimensions. Put aside the hosted core!</p>

  <h3>Name: overstimulated_mind</h3>
  <h3>vibe: </h3>
  <p>Almost going fade-out when my clarity is long-gone away. Cause some overstimulated feelings making my mind going scattered around. Then there you taking your breaths, trying to sway me away into inside of you. And your smells that I'm consuming. Feels like we are using each-other. It's not like these feelings are the only things that try to. I got other strings too! Damn! Who cares! I got things to do. Gonna make a random-recursive-nested feelings from all of those and simplify those no matter how deep these are! and gotta carve the abstracted one onto your body. A part of your body where no one but me with the will-free granted permission.</p>

  <h3>Name: truths_of_imaginary_being</h3>
  <h3>vibe: </h3>
  <p>There's everything inside me what you see and what you don't see in this whole universe. I'm the summed-up phenomena of what's happening and what's not. It's my very existence what's giving the universe it's meaning. No matter which point I'm on I'm always at the center. And I wasn't been created nor been emerged. Cause I was always been there and maybe not!</p>

  <h3>Name: wrapped_reality</h3>
  <h3>vibe: </h3>
  <p>YO! got a present for ya. A wrapped compacted one. To have a closer look to see it from a better perspective, try to make a cleave on it. Intertwined strings that try to diverge towards outside of their domain, so movable yet giving you a vibe of static, tries to get twisted with your reality giving you a feel so surreal, unrealistic feelings they try to give ya! Huh! It's better. But gotta be careful, the cat might get killed!</p>

  <h3>Name: compacted_vibez</h3>
  <h3>vibe: </h3>
  <p>My mind is thinking even before trying to think about what it needs to think of or maybe my mind doesn't know what it is even thinking of. It's like all the words are getting compacted into a single one inside my mind. Damn! cannot retain the ability to divide between what's wrong and right anymore.</p>

  <h3>Name: tight_zen</h3>
  <h3>vibe: </h3>
  <p>No matter how much I flow with them. They just don't make any clarified sense. They just either get dispersed or get intertwined or get contracted into a single source or get recursive-nested nuggets or may be all of them together.   Either way they maybe comes from a source that is so symmetrical or so randomized or can be both them, symmetrical and randomized. Damn! getting intertwined with them again.   Ain't they just what I call an un-clarified mind that is where they come from? So . .   "So, again, what is Zen? Stop now. Stop trying to get an intellectual lock on something that is vast and boundless, far more than the rational mind can grasp. Just breathe in with full awareness. Taste the breath. Appreciate it fully. Now breathe out, slowly, with equal appreciation. Give it all away; hold onto nothing. Breathe in with gratitude; breathe out with love. Receiving and offeringâ€”this is what we are doing each time we inhale and exhale. To do so with conscious awareness, on a regular basis, is the transformative practice we call Zen."
